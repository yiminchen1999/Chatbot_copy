Bereiter, C., & Scardamalia, M. - They conducted research on problem and project-based learning and their work is mentioned in the provided context.\n\n2. Chambel, T., Zahn, C., & Finke, M. - They conducted research on hypervideo design and support for contextualized learning.\n\n3. Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt - They conducted research on the Jasper Project, which focused on curriculum, instruction, assessment, and professional development.\n\n4. Edelson, D. C. - He developed a framework for the design of technology-supported inquiry activities, including project-based learning.\n\n5. Krajcik, J. - He conducted research on learning science content in a project-based environment.\n\n6. Rivet, A., Singer, J., Schneider, R., Krajick, J., Marx, R. - They conducted research on designing and developing effective curricula, specifically in the context of the evolution of water.\n\nThese are just a few examples of researchers who have studied project-based learning. There are many more researchers in the field who have contributed to the understanding of its effectiveness in promoting deep learning and engagement among students.\n\n- Citation: Muukkonen, H., Hakkarainen, K., & Lakkala, M.
